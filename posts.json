            "rendered": "<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supreme\u2019s approach to clothing was one born out of reaction. The clothing scene in the mid-90s was one filled with overproduction. In contrast, Supreme went the other way, creating limited stock that led to lines of customers outside. That led to the thing every brand is striving for, hype.\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And with this hype came a consumer ready to treat its clothing as more than temporary items. These fans are usually those who found out about Supreme from its cultural bonafides in the skate arena. When we spoke to one such collector in Carson Guo, he said he first found out about Supreme from seeing his skateboarding friends all having the Supreme stickers on the bottom of their boards. Andy also spoke about a similar connection, seeing the brand in New York after moving from Texas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The brand\u2019s counter cultural roots are one of the key attractors for the usual Supreme collector, who likely found out about Supreme through its skateboarding roots to its many collaborations with everyone from Dipset to Lou Reed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Combine counter cultural bonafides, scarcity and a customer who can\u2019t buy so much of the brand that they become bored and you have a long lasting brand. Supreme weren\u2019t the first to do any one of these things &#8212; queuing for clothes was long popular in Japan, Stussy was born out of surf culture in the late \u201880s and streetwear brands such as Walker Wear and Fubu had collaborated with the music world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But no one brand had combined these elements successfully without eventually giving into temptation and producing more.\u00a0 The vast majority of brands would remake a best seller, but Supreme\u2019s refusal to do so creates a cultural capital in keeping these goods, not just wearing them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite all of this, Supreme\u2019s collaboration with Louis Vuitton was a turning point. In the brand\u2019s earlier days, Supreme had often flipped designer logos on its signature box tees &#8212; as was common for streetwear brands at the time. But Louis Vuitton were the only brand who sent Supreme a cease and desist when the streetwear brand dropped its take on the LV logo.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To cease and desist to collaboration is rarely a journey brands take together, so it was surprising when the range was announced. While it\u2019s difficult to fathom now in a world of designer on designer collaborations, back in 2017 it was unfathomable that a brand like Louis Vuitton would collaborate with one like Supreme.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This added cache made the collab a magnet for collectors, who realised that the collection combined the cultural cache Supreme brought to the table with the design nous that Louis Vuitton had.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We spoke to Carson Guo and Andy, two Supreme collectors to find out about their history with collecting the brand, the importance of the Louis Vuitton collab and the typical Supreme collector.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>How did you get into collecting Supreme?\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>Andy:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I originally lived in Texas and after moving to New York, I saw people skating and doing graffiti. The whole place was basically infused with creativity, so all of these things interested me. There was one time where I walked past the supreme store, and there\u2019s all these people lining up outside. This was my first time seeing this and I got interested. So I went home and did some research about Supreme. To me, Supreme is the leader of streetwear and the face of the whole street culture. The brand just screams New York.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Carson:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I saw my friends skating and then one day I realized, they all had little supreme stickers underneath [their boards]. I asked them \u2018hey what&#8217;s going on with the supreme sticker? Like, what does it mean? Like is it a brand?\u2019\u00a0 They told me it was a brand and they sold skateboards, clothes, some pretty cool stuff. After that I went to some supreme stores. The first one ever visited was the one in Japan, the Shibuya store.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After that it was the London one, then Paris, New York and San Francisco. Then I got into the history of supreme and found out there were a lot of cool collaborations that they&#8217;ve done way before.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Who do you see as a typical Supreme collector?\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>Carson: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think everyone is a typical collector.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Andy: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ll say Carson, of course. Our families met each other back in Hong Kong. Even though collecting is not my family&#8217;s main trade, my dad was still very happy to support me. In China, pop stars and sports stars are collecting Supreme. And they have been doing so for a long time now. There\u2019s also people from the Middle east.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Does collecting Supreme differ from traditional art collecting?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>Carson: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t think it differs. Supreme is just more people friendly than fine art. More people are able to get into Supreme.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Andy: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest difference in my opinion, is that collecting Supreme is something that originated from our generation. So, as our generation Gen Z grows older, the respect for entire street culture has also grown. And even the luxury brands decided to accept these changes brought on by Gen Z. In terms of similarity, I will say that, just like collecting traditional artwork, collecting supreme will also live on and survive the test of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Where and how does Supreme build value?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>Andy: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe that what gives supreme its biggest value is the timing of things. But the brand was founded back in 1994. And when it got to the early 2000s, the brand basically entered its growing stage. By 2010, it was growing very rapidly. And as our generation grows older, can afford more things and get into collecting, the brand became more mature and appealing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe that the brand&#8217;s willingness to break rules and not conform is what made them the most valuable brand from streetwear culture. They still break rules to this day, like they didn&#8217;t change at all. That made it even more attractive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Carson: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important thing is the vision of Supreme. Supreme did what nobody would, or ever think about.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What did you think of the Louis Vuitton x Supreme collection when it launched?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>Andy:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Before it was announced, I wouldn&#8217;t have even dared to imagine that something like a collab between a streetwear brand and a luxury brand would be possible. Because supreme was the face of street wear and LV was essentially the face of the luxury world. So it was a very iconic collab between the best of both industries. When it was announced in 2017, I was very happy, and literally wanted to buy everything from the collab. But unfortunately, a lot of my resources were tied up in vintage supreme collecting.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Carson:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It was the most hyped up collab. Supreme was number one in its industry and then Louis is one of the top three brands in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>From your perspective, how did this collaboration change the fashion landscape?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>Carson:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It was like a bridge between two types of people &#8212; even two age groups. After that collab, we started seeing a lot more luxury brands collabing with streetwear. It started becoming a trend that people accepted and approved. Supreme was the pioneer that started all this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Andy: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0The collab was a sign of supreme growing and finally becoming an adult. The whole world knows about what Supreme is after that collaboration. It felt like Supreme was finally 21 years old and could go to the bar.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Have your collections increased in value?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>Andy:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Yes, of course, because we started collecting at a very early stage. But Carson and I are both collectors that are fundamentally passionate and love the culture. That&#8217;s where we began. We actually care about the brand, which means the monetary value change wasn&#8217;t really our focus. We&#8217;re still collecting every day, keeping track of all the sites from all over the world, we would still scout out the good opportunities, things and going back to the supreme LV clap I will say that it will only become more and more iconic, as time goes by and the classic in the future when we look back upon it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>How does collection Supreme x Louis Vuitton differ from collecting older Supreme?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>Andy:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The focus of our collection was box logo T shirts from when supreme was founded in 1994. And we have, over time, collected over 100 T-shirts in brand new condition still with tags. So, because of our standards, these were harder to collect than the newer items from the Supreme x Louis Vuitton collab.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Carson: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think it is more difficult although it&#8217;s a little bit different because some of the skateboards are very limited. And some of them are really old, so they\u2019re just hard to find. In comparison the Supreme Louis collection is\u00a0 fairly new and they made a lot of stuff. The Supreme Louis collab is definitely rare but some of the skateboards are a once in a lifetime kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n",
